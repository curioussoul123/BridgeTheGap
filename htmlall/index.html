            <p>Mental health comprises our emotional, psychological, and social security. It impacts how we think, feel, and act. It also helps conclude how we manage stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every phase of life, from childhood and adolescence through middle age.</p>

            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO): “Mental health is a state of well-being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.”</p>
                
            Over the course of one’s life, if one experiences mental health problems, one’s thinking, attitude, and behaviour could be impacted. Many aspects contribute to mental health problems, including:
                
            <ul>
                <li>Biological factors, such as genetic factor or brain chemistry</li>
                <li>Life experiences, such as trauma or exploitation </li>
                <li>Family history of mental health issues</li>
            </ul>
